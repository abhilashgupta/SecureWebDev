# Homo Arachnid

Project repository for the Secure Web Development block course, Sose 2020.
I have tested this using Google Chrome and Safari as the browser, running on Python 3.8.5 and Django 3.1

To run the project on another "port-number" than default 8000, start the django server as -
python manage.py runserver "port-number"

Project P1 is done.
Project P2 is done.
Project P3 is done.
Project P4 - when an unlogged user tries to add an item to cart/basket, they are redirected to the login page.
            Post login, the page doesn't redirect to the shopping page (couldn't figure this out.)
            The user sees a link to go to the shopping list page.
